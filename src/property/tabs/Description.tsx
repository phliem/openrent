        A unique two bedroom, two bathroom apartment in a handsome art deco
        period conversion, moments from Hackney Road. Artistically finished,
        with bespoke kitchen and parquet floors, it's a one of a kind home with
        a fifteen minute City commute. You'll be in a truly enviable spot at the
        very heart of Tower Hamlets. Just off Hackney Road, with an incredible
        variety of places to eat, drink, shop and explore within easy walking
        distance or a short bus or cycle ride away. From hidden cocktail clubs
        to peculiar museums, independent boutiques to cat cafes, you'll never
        want for something to do at the weekend.

        IF YOU LIVED HERE... Head up onto the first floor and open your front
        door, to find your bathroom immediately to your right. There's a sleek
        white suite including a freestanding rolltop tub and vanity sink. The
        walls are part tiled in simple white, and it's all bathed in natural
        light. Next is your fantastic kitchen, diner and lounge straight ahead
        of you. Giving you more than 500 square foot of versatile space, along
        with gorgeous parquet flooring underfoot, and dual aspect windows
        looking over the communal gardens. To the left in is your first bedroom
        of 120 square foot, a generous double. On the opposite side is your main
        bedroom, this one with 150 square foot of space and two double bespoke
        wardrobes, one with sliding mirror doors. To one end of this lovely
        space is your en suite shower room, as beautifully finished as your main
        bathroom, with terracotta walls and a step in shower, fully iled in
        glossy grey. Cambridge Heath station is a six minute walk. From here the
        Overground will speed you to Liverpool Street in another seven minutes
        and you are only a twelve minute walk to Bethnal Green Station for the
        central line. As for green spaces, Haggerston Park is three minutes from
        your new home, and contains both a city farm (with Italian cafe) and
        community orchard. London's legendary Victoria Park is less than a mile
        away, while Columbia Road with its wonderful, famous flower market is a
        four minute stroll from you.
